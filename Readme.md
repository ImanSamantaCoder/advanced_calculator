#Advanced Calculator

Description

This project is a simple yet advanced web-based calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It performs basic arithmetic operations as well as advanced mathematical functions, such as trigonometric calculations (sin, cos, tan, cot) and memory operations (M+, M-, MR, MC).

Features

Basic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

Advanced Calculations:

Trigonometric functions: sin(x), cos(x), tan(x), cot(x)

Memory functions: M+, M-, MR, MC

Error Handling: Prevents division by zero and invalid inputs

Keyboard Input Support: Users can input numbers and operators via keyboard

Stylish UI: A visually appealing black and yellow theme with a glowing effect

Advanced Calculations: Use sin, cos, tan, and cot for trigonometric calculations.

Memory Functions:

M+ (Memory Plus): Adds the current value to memory.

M- (Memory Minus): Subtracts the current value from memory.

MR (Memory Recall): Retrieves the stored memory value.

MC (Memory Clear): Clears the memory.

Clear Button (C): Resets the calculator.
